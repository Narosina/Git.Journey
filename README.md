and day 3 of creating a To-Do list via c++ programming language altough still no luck.

____Day 001 today i wrote a new form of plan or flow chart to write a percise schedule to write code and peractice my other skills, and
also its a value to have the discipline to put it to the motion and act on it, i may be successfull. 

____Day 002 today was the day to create a to-do list by cpp in which i desire to use FLTK library. and i obviously have to install it first which in
