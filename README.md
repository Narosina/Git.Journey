# Git.Journey
i'm writing this so to it be a, little journal of the things i do in tech and programming.

___Day 000 until this point its has been 2 years since i practiced basics of python and a great deal in depth c++ programming language
still day 000 and i'm by road map 2 month into in depth training for Software Engineering, and 1 year into iran, kerman azad university
of kerman, practicing computer engineering. And also 2 week into practicing self learn German / Deutsch for fun.
and day 3 of creating a To-Do list via c++ programming language altough still no luck.

____Day 001 today i wrote a new form of plan or flow chart to write a percise schedule to write code and peractice my other skills, and
also its a value to have the discipline to put it to the motion and act on it, i may be successfull. 

____Day 002 today was the day to create a to-do list by cpp in which i desire to use FLTK library. and i obviously have to install it first which in 
windows is not an easy task to do, and other than that i have to make neccessary perperations for it.

_also creating a 6-month road-map for game-development in unreal engine. actually an adventage is to make cpp based games with it.  

____Day 003 Today was kind of a chill day, i've been to university all day and peracticing german all day. hope i become better at it, it's kind of stressing.

____Day 004 today i want to practice, implament ques, stacks and also i have to bring my cat to the veterinarian what could go wrong.

____Day 005 i decided to travel to netherland, i must remember, learn the language, learn the skills and be hopefull and everything will be done on it self. 
i don't think it will happen this soon but hopefully in the next 4 years i'll be in the netherland.

_____also today  i'll be practicing sets and hash maps, in c++. i hope to make a good progress. 

_____i also have to study for physic-2 exam.

____Day 006 still practicing, nothing new.

____Day 008 Tomorrow iam taking the university physic-2 exam, wish me luck. 

____Day 009 today mid-term exam was very difficult, i really messed up today. but you know what they say its just another point, i practice better next time

_____Also today i started practicing, my english and making preperations for a level-up. and i just remembered it's late at night i probably should go to bed.

____DAY 10 today i wanted to rest so it was day which i just reveiwed some codes, fineded a few diffrent libraries iwanted to test, ( For c++ obviously), and that was it tomorrow i have to check for this weeks software development check list, and study for a diffrent up coming exam and finally work on the micro projects which i was neglecting for a long time. so untill tomorrow goodbye.

____Day 011 Today i'm learning to apply certains changes to my github account, how journal projects, and etc...,  and tomorrow iam changing my github account for the better. lets work hard and live easy.

____Day 012 Today iam changing, my git hub for better so this episode is github improve NO.01.

_____changed some basic things, things im currently learning, things i done, Uni iam studying at these sort of thing.

_____Added a contribute rating, and programming languages i learned. And of Course a goodread account. 

_____Beside github studied a little bit of Big-O ( complexity analysis ), PS: I still need to get deeper but for now it works.

____Day 013 hello its a diffrent day now that iam writing the journey which i dont think its very well written, but anyway i'm doing it to be a sign of my progress, Today i have to study for university but tomorrow i start learning, html and css. and ... i think i gonna practice for about a week. but after that i try going for react and flutter. 

____Day 014 Ok A New day starting learning html and css, week 1 saturday, starting by html, the source i decided to learn from was a very cool guy from youtube called [Neon learn.HTML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zcBBDcR5-M&list=PLTEzTFAAzxQ4RZ4ZMmIKkOaUeOsLqeFTT), he is an intresting guy to say the least and completely works for me to learn from him.

____Day 015 Today was premuch german day. so i just do some leet code training and thats it. GET BETTER EVERY DAY JUST A LITTLE BIT.^_^.

____Day 016 today is html practice day doing some practice some training and maybe some problem solving training, ( its advent of code day). 

____Day 17 today was, unfotunately was a very bad day. a day after tomorrow i have a university exam and today i was practicing and than i realized, to what extent. iam an iranian collage student in country that i cant even begin to hope for a better future, the whoel country is totall mess and i cant even getout do financiall problems. what is the use of waking up early in the morning all day, going to university learning new language, making a long list of projects, all this planning all this effort for what. the whole country is going to be at war soon, github deleted all my commits which i made over the last month ( now i look like a loser more than ever) and i dont have an income and nothing even looks good anymore. no parties no fun all ways just hard efforts and no gains. (PS: sorry for all this hard comments no one is going to read any of this anyway i just wanted to talk to someone so sorry for saying any of this in here its just depression talking.)   

____Day 18 alright back again we getting close to uni's final exam's  so we are back on track this week doing small html/css projects and peracticing programming. 

____Day 18 a few days passed since my last log and today iam learning more and more, i have finished my exams ( For now ) so back to becoming better and better at programming.  trying to start my project series and cpp perfection series. 


____Day 19 today i mstarting my first sites and micro projects. also starting to search for opern source projects that i can contribute to .
